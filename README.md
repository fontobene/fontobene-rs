This repository contains two things:

* The authoritative PEG grammar for the FontoBene font format
* A [FontoBene](https://github.com/fontobene/fontobene/) parser written with
  [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) and the
  [pest parser generator](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest) that acts both
  as a FontoBene parser and as a testsuite for the grammar.
